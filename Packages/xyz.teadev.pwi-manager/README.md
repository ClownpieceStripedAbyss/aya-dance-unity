# PWI Manager

This repo is dedicated to a basic but fully functional implementation of the PWI system from VRCX. If you don't want to make your own implementation(I don't blame you) or want another as an example of how everything works, and breaks, this repo is for that.

These scripts work as-is; You can import this package into your project and either add the VRCX Helper prefab and start using it, or add the PWI Manager script into your scene to reference yourself. The script will automatically initialize wih VRCX on start and become ready for use, if VRCX is present.

Thanks to [Nekromation](https://github.com/Nekromateion) for the initial implementation of this, working through my terrible spaghetti code.
